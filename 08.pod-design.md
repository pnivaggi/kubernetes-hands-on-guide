# Pod design

## Labels, Selectors and Annotations

To run applications you may have created a lot of different types of Objects in Kubernetes. Pods, Services, ReplicaSets,
Deployments... For Kubernetes, all of these are different objects. Over time you may end up having 100s and 1000s of these objects in your cluster. Then you will need a way to filter and view different objects by different categories like their type Pod, Service, Namespace... or per application App1, App2, App3... or per environment Development, Production... or per functionality Front-end, Back-end, Database...

For each object attach labels as per your needs, like app, function etc. Then while selecting, specify a condition to filter specific objects. For example app == App1.

Labels are key-value pairs. These pairs are attached to Object properties. They can be referenced by other objects for different purposes like Object selection.

Annotations are additional key-value pairs that can be attached to Kubernetes objects. They are used as metadata by users and external applications. While labels and selectors are used to group and select objects, annotations are used to record other details for informatory purpose. For example tool details like name, version build information etc or contact details, phone numbers, email ids etc, that may be used for some kind of integration purpose.

### Task 1. Declaring Labels

Let's define two Pods: frontend and backend with 3 labels:

* app - is used as a main for object reference
* version - application version


```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: frontend
  labels:
    app: frontend
    version: v1
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx
    name: nginx
EOF
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: db
  labels:
    app: backend
    version: v1
spec:
  containers:
  - image: mongo
    name: mongo
EOF
```

### Task 2. Inspecting Labels

Print Pods' descriptions to find their labels:

```bash
kubectl describe pod frontend db | grep -C 1 Labels:
```

```console
Node:             demo-worker/172.18.0.4
Start Time:       Tue, 04 Oct 2022 15:10:34 +0000
Labels:           app=webapp
                  version=v1
--
Node:             demo-worker2/172.18.0.2
Start Time:       Tue, 04 Oct 2022 15:10:45 +0000
Labels:           app=webapp
                  version=v1
```

### Task 3. Label Selectors

Use labels to filter pods out:

```bash
kubectl get pods -l app=frontend
```

```console
NAME       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
frontend   1/1     Running   0          100m
```

```bash
kubectl get pods -l app=backend
```

```console
NAME       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
db         1/1     Running   0          100m
```

It is also possible to build complex filters:

```bash
kubectl get pods -l 'app in (frontend, backend)'
```

```console
eti-lab> kubectl get pods -l 'app in (frontend, backend)'
NAME       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
db         1/1     Running   0          43s
frontend   1/1     Running   0          34s
```

or

```bash
kubectl get pods -l 'app,app notin (backend)'
```

```console
eti-lab> kubectl get pods -l 'app,app notin (backend)'
NAME       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
frontend   1/1     Running   0          3m12s
```

### Task 4. Delete Pods

```bash
kubectl delete pods -l app
```

```console
eti-lab> kubectl delete pods -l app
pod "db" deleted
pod "frontend" deleted
```

### Task 5. Declaring Annotations

Let's define pods with annotations related to the app git repository:

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: frontend
  annotations:
    giturl: "git@github.com:nginx/nginx.git"
    gitbranch: "master"
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx
    name: nginx
EOF
```

### Task 6. Inspecting Annotations

```bash
kubectl describe pod frontend | grep -C 1 Annotations:
```

```console
Labels:           <none>
Annotations:      gitbranch: master
                  giturl: git@github.com:nginx/nginx.git
```

### Task 7. Delete Pods

```bash
kubectl delete --all pods
```

```console
eti-lab> kubectl delete --all pods
pod "frontend" deleted
```

## Deployments and ReplicaSets

You have learned already to run Pods using kubectl. Doing so, upgrades and life-cycling are outside of scope of Kubernetes. If Pods are ran as part of a Deployment, Kubernetes will manage Pod's reliability and scalability. Application upgrades become simpler. A Deployment uses another Kubernetes Primitive - ReplicaSet. This primitive is focused on pod replicas. Deployments, ReplicaSet and Pod are objects in Kubernetes. Labels in each object define the relation between them.

The Deployment instructs Kubernetes how to create and update instances of your application. Once you've created a Deployment, the Kubernetes control plane schedules the application instances included in that Deployment to run on individual Nodes in the cluster.  

Once the application instances are created, a Kubernetes Deployment Controller continuously monitors those instances. If the Node hosting an instance goes down or is deleted, the Deployment controller replaces the instance with an instance on another Node in the cluster.

This provides a self-healing mechanism to address machine failure or maintenance.  

In a pre-orchestration world, installation scripts would often be used to start applications, but they did not allow recovery from machine failure. By both creating your application instances and keeping them running across Nodes, Kubernetes Deployments provide a fundamentally different approach to application management.

### Task 8. Create Deployment

You can create and manage a Deployment by using the Kubernetes command line interface, Kubectl. Kubectl uses the Kubernetes API to interact with the cluster. In this module, you'll learn the most common Kubectl commands needed to create Deployments that run your applications on a Kubernetes cluster.  

When you create a Deployment, you'll need to specify the container image for your application and the number of replicas that you want to run. You can change that information later by updating your Deployment.  

You can describe a Deployment in a YAML file. For your first Deployment, we will use this YAML file which describes a Deployment that runs the NGINX application packaged in Docker image. From the YAML manifest we can see that ngnix release 1.14.2 is used for the container image and 2 replicas are deployed:

```bash
kubectl create -f - <<"EOF"
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  replicas: 2 # tells deployment to run 2 pods matching the template
  template: # specifies with metadata and spec which Pod template to use for replicas
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
EOF
```

Check the deployment configuration and status:

```bash
kubectl describe deployment nginx-deployment
```

You should have a similar output:

```console
eti-lab> kubectl describe deployment nginx-deployment
Name:                   nginx-deployment

  Normal  ScalingReplicaSet  3m17s  deployment-controller  Scaled up replica set nginx-deployment-7fb96c846b to 2
```

Check the Pods deployed and controlled by the `nginx-deployment`:

```bash
kubectl get pods -l app=nginx
```

You should have a similar output:

```console
eti-lab> kubectl get pods -l app=nginx
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

nginx-deployment-7fb96c846b-msctw   1/1     Running   0          5m17s
```

Check the Pod configuration and status and notice it is controlled by a deployment

First let's select the first Pod from the list of Pods labelled app=nginx:

```bash
export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -l app=nginx -o go-template='{{(index .items 0).metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}')
```

```console
eti-lab> export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -o go-template='{{(index .items 0).metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}')
```

Then describe the Pod:

```bash
kubectl describe pod $POD_NAME
```

You should have a similar output:

```console
eti-lab> kubectl describe pod $POD_NAME

```

Check the Pods deployed and controlled by the `nginx-deployment`:

```bash
kubectl get pods -l app=nginx
```

### Task 9. Scale deployment

You can increase the number of Pods in your Deployment by applying a new YAML file or using imperative command with replicas option. Let's run the latest:

```bash
kubectl scale deployment nginx-deployment --replicas=4
```

```console
eti-lab> kubectl scale deployment nginx-deployment --replicas=4
```

Check the Pods deployed and controlled by the `nginx-deployment`:

```bash
kubectl get pods -l app=nginx
```

You should have a similar output:

```console
eti-lab> kubectl get pods -l app=nginx
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-deployment-7fb96c846b-7v9gz   1/1     Running   0          33m

nginx-deployment-7fb96c846b-msctw   1/1     Running   0          33m
nginx-deployment-7fb96c846b-rh4l9   1/1     Running   0          114s
```

Notice you have 4x Pods deployed as specified by `replicas=4`

You can also check the deployment configuration and status with the following command:

```bash
kubectl describe deployment nginx-deployment
```

```console
eti-lab> kubectl describe deployment nginx-deployment
Name:                   nginx-deployment
Namespace:              default
CreationTimestamp:      Sun, 09 Oct 2022 06:29:37 +0000

  Normal  ScalingReplicaSet  21m   deployment-controller  Scaled up replica set nginx-deployment-7fb96c846b to 4 from 2
```

Notice the `Events` section with message: Scaled up replica set nginx-deployment-7fb96c846b to 4 from 2.

### Task 10. Update deployment

You can update the image for the Pods by updating your Deployment. Let's apply a new manifest for our `nginx-deployment`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<"EOF"
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  replicas: 2 # tells deployment to run 2 pods matching the template
  template: # specifies with metadata and spec which Pod template to use for replicas
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.16.1 # modify the nginx image
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
EOF
```

Check the Deployment configuration and status:

```bash
kubectl describe deployment nginx-deployment
```

```console
eti-lab> kubectl describe deployment nginx-deployment
Name:                   nginx-deployment
Namespace:              default
CreationTimestamp:      Sun, 09 Oct 2022 06:29:37 +0000

  Normal  ScalingReplicaSet  23m   deployment-controller  Scaled down replica set nginx-deployment-7fb96c846b to 0 from 1
```

Notice the `Events` message, the controller is scaling down the replica to 0 then it scales up the replica up to 2 as specified in the `replicas=2` statement. The new Pods created are with the new specified nginx release `nginx:1.16.1`.

### Task 11. Delete deployment

You can delete the deployment running the following command:

```bash
kubectl delete deployment nginx-deployment
```

```console
eti-lab> kubectl delete deployment nginx-deployment
deployment.apps "nginx-deployment" deleted
```

## Jobs and CronJobs

By default, Pod's run applications continuously. However, if functionality has a clear completion goal, a Job needs to be used. Jobs are designed to stop related containers when tasks are completed. Jobs are customized with number of completions and parallelism. If a functionality needs to be start in specific periods of time, CronJobs are to be used.

### Task 12. Creating CronJobs

Create a CronJob which will be started every 1 minute.

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: db-backup
  labels:
        job: db-backup
spec:
  schedule: "* * * * *"
  jobTemplate:
    metadata:
      labels:
        job: db-backup
    spec:
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            job: db-backup
        spec:
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
          containers:
            - name: runner
              image: ubuntu
              command: ["echo", "db backup completed"]
              securityContext:
                runAsUser: 0
EOF
```

### Task 13. Inspecting CronJobs

List CronJobs:

```bash
kubectl get cronjob -l job=db-backup
```

```console
NAME        SCHEDULE    SUSPEND   ACTIVE   LAST SCHEDULE   AGE
db-backup   * * * * *   False     1        0s  
```

List related Jobs:

```bash
kubectl get job -l job=db-backup
```

```console
NAME                 COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
db-backup-27749569   1/1           4s         2m11s
db-backup-27749570   1/1           4s         71s
db-backup-27749571   1/1           4s         11s
```

List related Pods:

```bash
kubectl get pod -l job=db-backup
```

```console
NAME                       READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
db-backup-27749569-lrlq8   0/1     Completed   0          2m18s
db-backup-27749570-txp5c   0/1     Completed   0          78s
db-backup-27749571-6f55p   0/1     Completed   0          18s
```

### Task 14. Delete CronJobs

```bash
kubectl delete cronjob db-backup
```

```console
eti-lab> kubectl delete cronjob db-backup
cronjob.batch "db-backup" deleted
```
